.Synopsis
    This script is designed to install the Carbon Black Sensor on Multiple
    clients given as input through a list of those client names (Host Names)
    in a .TXT file.

    The script will ask the user for the path of the hostnames in a .TXT
    document. 

    Then the script will ask user for the location of the Carbon Black Sensor
    Installer Package folder.

    Then the script will ping the host, and proceed with further instructions
    until the Carbon Black Sensor is installed on the remote client.
    
.DESCRIPTION
    BulkInstall-CarbonBlackSensor installs the Carbon Black Sensor on remote
    host names provided in a .txt file.

    User running this script must be an admin on remote machine
    ("Workstation Admin" if you are in an Enterprise Environment) to
    succesfully complete the install, and the remote machine must be
    online (internal network) to have successfully installed the
    Carbon Black Sensor.

    The following files are required in order for this script to work:

    1) CarbonBlackSensor Installation folder with settings.ini file and the
    CarbonBlackClientSetup.exe Executable.

    2) A .TXT file with hostnames on each new line, so no 2 hostnames on a
    single line. Also, no extra spaces after the hostnames and no empty lines
    to avoid any unnecessary errors.

    3) The script also uses PSEXEC.EXE, part of Sysinternal Tools, which
    can be downloaded here:
    https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/psexec.aspx

    4) It is convenient to place all files, This powershell script, the
    hostnames.txt file, the CarbonBlackSensor installation folder and PSEXEC.EXE
    into the same directory, such as c:\Temp and then launch the script from
    there in with elevated priveledges in your own machine.

.EXAMPLE
    BulkInstall-CarbonBlackSensor -PathOfComputerList .\hostnames.txt -CarbonBlackSensorInstallerPath C:\Temp\CarbonBlackSensor

    This example command will run the script using the hostnamest.txt file and
    the CarbonBlackSensor installer folder based on the specific paths
    provided on the Command line.

    Put Quotes around your file path if your file path has spaces in it.

.EXAMPLE
    BulkInstall-CarbonBlackSensor

    If you just run this script like this, it will simply run and then
    prompt you for the necessary information.

.NOTES
    User running this script MUST be an admin on the remote host because this script
    copies files over the c:\Temp directory and then launches an executable from
    that directory.

    PowerShell execution policy on current user will need to be changed to
    Unrestricted or ByPass to run this script. The Execution policy can be reset
    back to Restricted after script is done running.
